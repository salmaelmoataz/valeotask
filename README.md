# ✨Static website on S3✨

## Description
we are targeting to create static website that hosted on S3 on AWS and go globally through cloud front distribution, there are some limits for this website:
1. this website availble to specific range of IPs only and we achieve this by using WAF
2. if you pass WAF protection you will face another layer of security that requires from you username and password
also we will create a user that has CLI access only, this user allowed to upload files with name of "index.html" only to the bucket with specific IP
 


## Requirements
- having access to AWS
- [Installing  AWS CLI] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Installing terraform] (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)


## Walking through
We can discuss our solution through 5 steps:

1. create user and its requirments(policy and access key)
2. create WAF and its requirments(ipset and role)
3. create lambda function and its requirments(code of function and policies)
4. create S3 and its requirments(policies and static website file)
5. create cloudfront distribution


## 1- Create user and its requirments(policy and access key)
i used the official documention of terraform to help me creating the user (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_user)
1. i used resource "aws_iam_user" to create the user and use attribute "name to give this user name
2. i used the resourse "aws_iam_access_key" and provide it with the user name to give it access key and activate it
3. i used the resource "aws_iam_user_policy" to give the user policy, this policy will allow the user to list the content of the bucket and upload files on it only if the file name is "index.html"

## 2- Create WAF and its requirments(ipset and role)
i used the official documention of terraform to help me creating the WAF (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/waf_web_acl)
1. i used resource "aws_waf_ipset" to identify the range of IPs that will allowed to access the website
2. i used resource "aws_waf_rule" to create the rule for WAF and match IPs
3. i used the resource "aws_waf_web_acl" that depends on the rule and ipset, to check the rquest and allow it or refuse it depends on some attributes in the resource(default_action and rules), rule and ip set

## 3- Create lambda function and its requirments(code of function and policies)
i used the official documention of terraform to help me creating the Lambda function (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lambda_function#version)
1. i used the resource "aws_iam_policy" to give the lambda policy to use cloud watch to create logs 
2. i used the resource "aws_iam_role" to give lambda role to use edge lambda
3. i used the resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" to attach the policy to the rule 
4. i used the resource "aws_lambda_function" to create lambda function and provide it with the code and rule 

## 4- Create S3 and its requirments(policies and static website file)
i used the official documention of terraform to help me creating the S3 (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket)
1. i used the resource "aws_s3_bucket" to create bucket and used attribute "policy" to give it policy for two things:
1. make it public for hosting the website
2. restrict the users that can upload files in it by using whitelist IP
seconed attribute "lifecycle rule" to delete files automatically when it last for one year third attribute "versioning" to enable version for website
forth attribute "website" to tell that the file "index.html" will be the index document and file "error.html: will be the error document for the websitee

## 5- create cloudfront distribution
i used the official documention of terraform to help me creating the cloud front distribution (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudfront_distribution#restriction_type)
1. i used the resource "aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity" because every distribution should have at least one orgin
2. i used the resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" to create cloudfront distribution it has some attributes like:
1. origin: every distribution should have origin in our case will be S3
2. default_cache_behavior: it is important to identify the time that cliud front will retrive data from S3 again and in it we connect our lambda function with cloud front to use it
3. web_acl_id: allow us to connect between our WAF and cloudfront


## configuration

1. we should specify our cloud provider in our case it will be AWS and specify the region that will work on it

2. we will write the code in file test1.tf and identify all functions and its attributes and also write file for variables var.tfvars and files for policies and lambda code

3. we will connect our machine with AWS using access and secret keys with command "AWS configure"

4. we will run command "terraform init" to intialize the connection between terraform and my account on AWS

5. we will run command "terraform plan -var-file var.tfvars" to see what the file will create on AWS

6. we will run command "terraform apply "terraform apply -var-file var.tfvars" to apply our code

7. after finish we can delete every thing by command "terraform destroy -var-file var.tfvars" it will work correct in case we doesnot change any thing in the environment 

## Testing Service
after creating every thing, we will sign in to the console and get keys for our user that we create and upload file index.html to our S3 if it upload correct then the user and s3 is okay then go to cloudfront in the console and get the link for our distribution it will be like this "https://dcf7ohgoasq3e.cloudfront.net/" we will test it on any browser engine like: google, if our Ip in the ip set of WAF it will move to seconed stage that pop up a window that we will enter in it username and password if it right the static website will appear, if it wrong error page will appear
